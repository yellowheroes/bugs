CRUD
Create: The creation of a new bug report. We need user input - form: title(text) and description(textarea).
        - Store the title in column 'title'

        Status automatically becomes 'new' on initiation of a new report.
        - Store status 'new' in column 'status'.

/*
 * bug reports move from 'new' to 'accepted' to 'in progress'
 * to 'awaiting validation' to 'fixed' during their life-cycle.
 *
 * An update may just be a bug-report status moving to a new
 * stage in its lifecycle (e.g. from 'new' to 'accepted')
 * or it could also entail an update to the content of the bug-report.
